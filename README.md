LD38-Exploitation
============================

Submission for Ludum Dare #38.

Playable at http://www.dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD38/

Ship people off to nearby islands to harvest as much food to keep your home population alive for as long as is possible (and is profitable), in this light strategy game!

Arrow keys or WASD to move, mouse to choose options from the Port menu on the right when in port.

Basic rules that might not be clear:
3 people plus 1 harvester will convert 1 agriculture into 1 food each month.
Any leftover people will use mines to generate money.
1 food feeds up to 50 people each month.

I had very little time for this Ludum Dare, so really skimped on the sounds and polish, and I'm not quite sure what I ended up building is actually *fun*... but I'll leave that for you to decide!
